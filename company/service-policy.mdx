# Document Summary

This document addresses Babbage Insight's following policies:
* SLA (Service Level Agreement): defines the measurable levels of service the provider must deliver.
* Grievance Redressal: how customer complaints and grievances are identified, acknowledged, and resolved.
* Escalation: process for escalating unresolved issues to higher levels of authority or expertise.

# Service Level Agreement

This Service Level Agreement ("SLA") outlines the service performance standards, commitments, and obligations of Babbage Insight ("Service Provider") to its clients ("Service Recipients") for the provision of the SAAS (Services). The SLA ensures clarity on uptime, downtime, maintenance, escalation processes, and other critical terms to deliver consistent and reliable services.

## 1. Scope of the SLA
This SLA applies to the use of services as provided by the Service Provider. It defines the service levels, support terms, and remedies available to Service Recipients if the Service Provider fails to meet its commitments. This SLA forms part of the agreement between the Service Provider and the Service Recipient.

## 2. Key Service Commitments
### 2.1 Uptime Commitment
Service Provider guarantees a monthly uptime of 99%.

**Uptime Calculation:**
```
Uptime Percentage = \(\frac{(Total Time - Downtime)}{Total Time} \times 100\)
```

**Exclusions:**
- Scheduled Maintenance (Section 2.3).
- Force majeure events, such as natural disasters, acts of war, or government mandates.
- Service Recipient-side issues, such as network failures or misconfigurations.

### 2.2 Downtime
Downtime refers to any period during which the Service is unavailable or inaccessible due to issues on the Service Provider's side.

**Reporting:** Downtime incidents must be reported through the official support channels.

**Service Credits:** Service Credits are defined as the extension of the Service Agreement past the Initial Term, without additional payment, by a pro-rated number of days corresponding to the amount of Service Credit available proportional to the Software Subscription Fees.

**Compensation:** If uptime falls below 99%, Service Credits will be issued as follows:
- **95% – 99% uptime:** 5% of the monthly subscription fee.
- **90% – 94.99% uptime:** 10% of the monthly subscription fee.
- **Less than 90% uptime:** 20% of the monthly subscription fee.

### 2.3 Scheduled Maintenance
- Scheduled Maintenance will occur during off-peak hours: [e.g., Sundays from 2:00 AM to 6:00 AM UTC].
- Service Recipients will receive at least 48 hours' advance notification for scheduled maintenance.
- Maintenance will not exceed 8 hours per month, except for exceptional circumstances, which will be communicated promptly.
