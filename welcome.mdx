# About Us

## What is Babbage Insight?
Babbage Insight is your **Virtual Chief Analytics Officer**, which continuously monitors your data and provides you *exceptional insights* about your business.

## How does it work?
You simply tell us your *high-level* key business metrics, and the queries to
compute them.

"High level" means we only want the top-level metrics. For example: one metric
each for revenue, profit margins, customer acquisition cost, and churn rate. No need to go any deeper.

Babbage Insight then figures out the intricacies of your data. It will track your metrics, and (like a **good** Chief Analytics Officer), anticipate what questions you might ask. It asks the questions, answers them, and generates periodic reports with *exceptional insights*.

For example, you add metrics like this:

That's it. Disaggregations, correlations, "trees" - all that we figure out.

And then at the desired frequency, you get reports like this:

<img src ="assets/dashboard/my-report.png" height="500px"/>

Each user gets their own, custom version of this.
