## What is Babbage Insight?

Babbage Insight is your **Virtual Chief Analytics Officer**, which continuously monitors your data and provides you *exceptional insights* about your business.

## How does it work?

You simply tell us your key business metrics, and the queries to compute them.

Babbage then figures out the intricacies of your data. It will track your metrics, and (like a **good** Chief Analytics Officer), anticipate what questions you might ask. It asks the questions, answers them, and generates periodic reports with *exceptional insights*.

For example, you add metrics like this:

That's it - you only need to give us the key metrics. Disaggregations, correlations, "trees" - all that we figure out. OK there are some more details, which you can see in [**our Console**](/dashboard)!

And then at the desired frequency, you get reports like this:

If you need a demo, [email the Babbage Insight team](mailto:team@babbageinsight.com) anytime!
