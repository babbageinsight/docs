*The API key will override any previously entered OpenAI key.*


## Coming Soon
Babbage Insight currently supports only OpenAI.

The following features are on our Roadmap:
* **Alternate Providers**: Support for other common and prominent LLM providers such as Anthropic's Claude.
* **On-Premise LLMs**: Provision of Docker images of open weight LLMs (e.g. Llama3) running on a popular service (e.g. Ollama), for one-click deployment on your private cloud (e.g. AWS.)
