title: My Insights

## Introduction

**This is the "home" page of the Dashboard.** It is the first page that users
see when they first visit the Dashboard or switch to a different Project.

It is where you manage, and investigate all the Insights that Babbage
Insight produces.

## Steps

1. Visit the My Insights page.

3. Click on the title of an Insight to view it in its own page. *You can share that URL as a permalink; be assured that only permissioned users will be allowed to access it.*

## Coming Soon
* **Insight Flow**: No more static insights! The Babbage Insight will carefully
  curate yor insight so that you see a streamlined narrative that evolves with
  your data. If you saw an insight before, you won't see it again unless it
  becomes significant once again. You only ever see only the most relevant and impactful insights.

* Personal Queries: Free-form queries to dive deeper into a particular insight.
  Babbage Insight will generate the top 3 follow-up queries that the Insight
  triggers investigation. And in a future release, we will also allow "Co-Pilot" functionality, or
  free-form querying of the Insight.

  insight.
